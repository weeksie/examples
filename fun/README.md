Yeah. Never write B* trees in Haskell. I did a bad thing and I should feel bad.

But it was fun. And, hey, it was like 8 years ago. And Haskell is awfully pretty.


## lineshove.el

The _only_ thing I missed when I moved to Emacs from Eclipse about ten
years ago was the way that Eclipse let you cmd-arrow down or up to
move a line and cmd-ctrl-arrow to copy lines around. So I wrote that
in an hour or so (I would be SOOOO cool if I said it took me five
minutes. It didn't. Sad.)

Emacs is a harsh mistress though. I can never leave and I blame this
little gateway into programming the shit out of my text editor.
